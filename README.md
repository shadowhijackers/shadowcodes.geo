# SHADOW CODES 
  This is the open source project with no licence. This project 
Demonstrate the converstion of geocodes into some readable words but
here i have just used the some radome letters that generated from 
my own program. you can replace words instead auto generates words.

  > In this program i am just using 4 decimal part of lat and long. totally
 001.0000, 001.0000. 

# How it works.
  Its just like number sytem binary, octo and hex but here
we are using base is 1000 by default(depends on how much words in WORD_DB).

# Code explantion
  That you can see it in the `engine.js`.

# Licence
  No Licence free to use. If you like it just start it and fork it.
